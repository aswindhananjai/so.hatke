# Sample Image Placeholders

Since the image generation service is experiencing capacity issues, I've created a placeholder system for you.

## What's Been Added

✅ **One sample denim jacket**: `levis-light.jpg` (Levi's Light Wash)  
✅ **Logo placeholder**: Using screenshot as temporary logo

## Next Steps: Adding Your Own Images

### Option 1: Use Free Stock Images (Quick Start)

You can use free stock photo sites to get denim jacket images:

**Recommended sites:**
- **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) - Search "denim jacket"
- **Pexels** (pexels.com) - Search "jean jacket"  
- **Pixabay** (pixabay.com) - Free commercial use

**How to use:**
1. Download jacket images
2. Rename to match format: `{brand}-{color}.jpg`
3. Place in `assets/denim/`

### Option 2: Take Your Own Photos

1. Photograph your actual denim jackets
2. Use consistent lighting and background
3. Crop to 800x800px square
4. Save as JPG in `assets/denim/`

### Option 3: Use AI Image Generation

Use services like:
- **Midjourney** - High quality product images
- **DALL-E** - OpenAI's image generator
- **Stable Diffusion** - Free, open-source

**Example prompts:**
```
"Product photography of a dark wash denim jacket, front view, white background, 800x800px"
"Black denim trucker jacket, centered, professional product photo"
```

## Graphics (Transparent PNGs)

For the design graphics, you can:

1. **Use emoji as temporary placeholders** (current approach)
2. **Create in design software**: Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma
3. **Use AI**: Generate designs and remove background
4. **Commission an artist**: Fiverr, Upwork for custom designs

### Tools for removing backgrounds:
- **remove.bg** - Automatic background removal
- **Photoshop** - Select and delete
- **Figma** - Export as PNG with transparency

## Current Status

The website will work with the current emoji placeholders. You can:
1. Test the functionality now
2. Replace images gradually as you create/find them
3. The CSV system makes it easy to swap images anytime

## Quick Test

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the current state with the one sample image!
