# Back-View Denim Jacket Images Guide

## Overview
Since the custom graphics/paintings will be applied to the **back** of the denim jacket, we need back-view images showing the rear of each jacket.

## Required Images

You need **back-view** images for each brand-color combination:

### Naming Convention
Format: `{brand}-{color}.jpg`

- `levis-ombre.jpg` - Ombre gradient, back view

**Zara:**
- `zara-light.jpg` - Light wash, back view

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG
- **Background**: White or transparent

### Composition Tips
- Show the entire back of the jacket
- Ensure the back panel is clearly visible (this is where graphics overlay)
- Consistent lighting across all images
- Same angle/perspective for all jackets
- Jacket should be laid flat or on a mannequin (back view)

## How to Get Back-View Images

### Option 1: AI Image Generation (Recommended)

Use AI tools like **Midjourney**, **DALL-E**, or **Stable Diffusion**:

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Product photography of a Levi's denim jacket back view, light wash blue, centered on white background, 800x800px"

"Back view of a black denim jacket, product photography style, white background, centered composition"

"Rear view of a dark wash denim trucker jacket, professional product photo, square format"
```

**Services:**
- **Midjourney** (midjourney.com) - $10/month, high quality
- **DALL-E** (openai.com) - Pay per image
- **Leonardo.ai** - Free tier available
- **Stable Diffusion** (stability.ai) - Free/open source

### Option 2: Stock Photo Sites

Search for "denim jacket back view" or "jean jacket rear":

- **Unsplash** (unsplash.com)
- **Pexels** (pexels.com)
- **Pixabay** (pixabay.com)
- **Adobe Stock** (stock.adobe.com) - Paid

**Search terms:**
- "denim jacket back view"
- "jean jacket rear"
- "trucker jacket back"
- "denim jacket flat lay back"

### Option 3: Photograph Your Own Jackets

If you have physical jackets:

1. Lay jacket flat on white surface (back facing up)
2. Take photo from directly above
3. Use consistent lighting
4. Crop to 800x800px square
5. Ensure back panel is clearly visible

### Option 4: Commission a Designer

Hire on **Fiverr** or **Upwork**:
- Search for "product photography" or "product mockup"
- Request back-view denim jacket images
- Provide color specifications
- Budget: $5-20 per image set

## Current Status

✅ **1 image** - `levis-light.jpg` (currently front view, should be replaced with back view)  
⬜ **15 images needed** - All other brand-color combinations

## Quick Start

1. **Generate/source one test image** (e.g., `levis-dark.jpg` back view)
2. **Place in** `assets/denim/` folder
3. **Test** by selecting Levi's + Dark Wash in configurator
4. **Verify** the back view displays correctly
5. **Generate remaining images** using same method

## Why Back View?

The graphics (Ace of Spades, Lightning McQueen, etc.) will be painted/printed on the **back panel** of the jacket. The back view allows customers to see:
- How the graphic will look on the actual jacket
- The canvas area where their design will appear
- A realistic preview of the final product

## Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred method (AI generation recommended)
2. Start with 3-4 test images (one brand, all colors)
3. Verify they display correctly in the configurator
4. Generate the remaining images
5. Replace the current front-view `levis-light.jpg` with a back-view version
